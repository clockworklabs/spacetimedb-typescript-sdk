## SpacetimeDB SDK

### Overview

This repository contains the TypeScript SDK for SpacetimeDB. The SDK allows to interact with the database server and is prepared to work with code generated from a SpacetimeDB backend code.

### Installation

The SDK is an NPM package, thus you can use your package manager of choice like NPM or Yarn, for example:

```
npm install --save @clockworklabs/spacetimedb-sdk
```

You can use the package in the browser, using a bundler like webpack of vite, and in terminal applications

### Usage

In order to connect to a database you have to create a new client:

```ts
import { SpacetimeDBClient } from "@clockworklabs/spacetimedb-sdk";

let client = new SpacetimeDBClient("spacetimedb.com/spacetimedb", "<db-name>");
```

If you would like to connect to the client you can call the below method. This also takes optional parameters to override the host or credentials:

```ts
client.connect();
```

If for some reason you need to disconnect the client:

```ts
client.disconnect();
```

This will connect to a database instance without a specified identity. If you want to persist an identity fetched on connection you can register an `onConnect` callback, which will receive a new assigned identity as an argument:

```ts
client.onConnect((identity: string) => {
  console.log(identity);
  console.log(client.token);
});
```

You may also pass credentials as an optional third argument:

```ts
let credentials = { identity: "<identity>", token: "<token>" };
let client = new SpacetimeDBClient(
  "spacetimedb.com/spacetimedb",
  "<db-name>",
  credentials
);
```

Typically, you will use the SDK with types generated from a backend DB service. For example, given a component named `Player` you can subscribe to player updates by registering the component:

```ts
client.registerComponent(Player, "Player");
```

Then you will be able to register callbacks on insert and delete events, for example:

```ts
Player.onInsert((newPlayer: Player) => {
  console.log(newPlayer);
});
```

Given a reducer called `CreatePlayer` you can call it using a call method:

```ts
CreatePlayer.call("Nickname");
```
